Engineering Design 2

This module was done in Semester 2 of my second year studying engineering in TCD.
We were required to design a autonomous vehicle that would follow a single strip of whipe tape around a black mat.
An arduino UNO microproccessor was used to control the buggy. And XBEEs were used to wirelessly comunicate infromation
to the buggy in real time.
IR sensors were used to steer the buggy and and infrared sensor was used to report the buggys location back to the operator.
A pixy cam was used to allow the buggy to make decisions such which turn to take at a junction by regocnizing colours layed on the mat.
